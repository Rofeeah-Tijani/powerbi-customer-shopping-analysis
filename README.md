# 🛍️ Customer Shopping Behavior Analysis with Power BI

## 📌 Project Overview
This project explores customer shopping behavior using transaction-level data collected across multiple shopping malls.  
The analysis leverages **Power BI** to uncover insights into spending patterns, demographic differences, product category preferences, and payment trends.  

By transforming raw sales data into interactive dashboards, the project demonstrates how **businesses can use analytics to understand their customers better, improve marketing strategies, and boost profitability**.

## ❗ Problem Statement
Retail businesses often struggle to:  
- Identify **which customer segments** drive the most revenue.  
- Understand **which product categories** perform best across demographics.  
- Track **seasonal and location-based trends** in sales.  
- Align **payment preferences** with customer experience.  

Without clear insights, decision-making becomes reactive rather than proactive.

1. **Analyze shopping behavior** across age, gender, and location.  
2. Identify **high-performing categories** and **seasonal purchase trends**.  
3. Track **payment preferences** across customer segments.  
4. Build a **Power BI dashboard** that helps stakeholders make informed, data-driven decisions.
